# Visiting(MERN) app
The purpose of this project was to learn redux, node.js and non-relational database.
Web applications we wrote at school used ASP.NET for RESTful services
but I was interested how to build RESTful services with node.js.

With this project I also looked into making authentication possible with Google accounts.

Knowledge of different architectures came with the help of youtube course by the channel named Javascript Mastery.
