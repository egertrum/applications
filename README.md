# My applications

In this repository I have some of the projects that I have done 
at school and some that I have written in my spare time.
~~~~
All of the projects have a description aswell in their specific folder.

Additionally to C# and Javascript I have also used other languages for school projects.
~~~~
Python - first language that I learned. I have written programs for smaller problems
and games.
PHP - first real experience with HTTP requests and a CRUD app.
Java - first look into unit tests and different algorithmic programs.
