# Quiz and poll app
This was my exam task for Distributed systems, ASP.NET and Javascript subjects.
    
We were given 72 hours for this web application and the task was to build a database and app
so that the user could answer to quizzes that also give them feedback and to polls
where they could leave a feedback to polls.


Application uses two different frameworks for client side - ASP.NET and Vue.
Javascript framework was given to me randomly.

The goal of the application was not that much clean code but rather if the student was able to
create something usable in 72 hours.
