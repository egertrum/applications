### Distributed Systems
Building distributed systems was a subject that was necessary in the concept that school would accept student's future internships.

This was based on a web application that was rather quite big where student had to build
considerably complicated database and on top of that an application that managed the data and consisted also of some logic
and that had to follow a 3 layer architecture. 

ASP.NET is used mainly for this application where as one of the clients is written also with React. The other
client is built with ASP.NET razor pages.

In this project testing was mandatory and it consisted of some unit and integration tests.
Multiple languages were also needed in this course so got to know quite a bit about translating the application UI and data. 

This project also had to be deployed so it was an introduction to Docker and I used Microsoft Azure websites to host my application.
